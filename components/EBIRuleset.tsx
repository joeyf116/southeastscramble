          <li>No points, no judges, submission only</li>
          <li>All submissions are legal.</li>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">The “Get Down” Rule</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If both competitors are on their feet (wrestling, standing grappling,
          etc.) for 1 minute straight, a horn will sound and the competitors
          will be forced to go to the mat and restart in sit-up guard/butterfly
          guard position with the competitor on bottom with double under hooks
          of his own and his head on either shoulder of the competitor on top.
          No placing your head in the center under opponent’s chin.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If one opponent is CLEARLY the aggressor while standing, then he gets
          to choose if he wants to be top or bottom. Otherwise, a coin flip will
          determine which competitor chooses to be top or bottom.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The “get down” clock resets each time both competitors are on their
          feet and standing/wrestling again.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">Stalling Penalty</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If one of the competitors is clearly stalling, the referee will give a
          warning to that competitor and his or her corner.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the stalling continues and is clearly obvious, the referee will
          stop the action and announce a penalty – 1 minute of “escape time”
          added to that competitor’s OT time. There are no limits to the amount
          of penalty calls that a referee can give.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The most common stalling penalties are given when one competitor is
          grounded and his opponent remains on his feet and refuses to attempt
          to pass the guard of the grounded opponent.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">
          EBI Overtime (1 round minimum/3 rounds maximum)
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If there is no submission after the regulation time limit, each
          competitor will have the chance to try to submit their opponent as
          fast as they can, while the other has a chance to escape. There will
          be a coin toss to determine which competitor will choose if they are
          starting on offense or defense.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>How to win in overtime:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>Submit your opponent faster than he or she can submit you.</li>
          <li>If there is no submission by end of overtime</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One overtime round means that a competitor had a chance at both
          offense and defense. There are up to three overtime rounds maximum per
          match.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">
          Example of one overtime round:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Top of the 1st round = Competitor A on offense, Competitor B on
          defense. Bottom of the 1st round = Competitor B on offense, Competitor
          A on offense.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Each part of the overtime round is two minutes maximum. If there is no
          submission or escape after two minutes, the competitors move on to the
          next part of overtime.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Example: Bottom of the 1st round, Competitor B is on offense,
          Competitor A is on defense. Neither competitor submitted or escaped
          after 2 minutes, meaning the competitors stop and move on to the Top
          of the 2nd round.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">
          The competitor on offense gets to choose if they want to start in back
          control or armbar. Offense options:
        </h3>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            Back control with a seatbelt grip (grip must be in the middle of the
            opponent’s chest). The defensive competitor may only secure his
            grips in a “pull up” fashion on the offensive competitor’s arms, but
            cannot sneak his or her hands inside the offensive competitor’s
            grips. Competitor on defense must sit up with perfect posture and
            may not lean forward or sideways until the referee officially starts
            the OT round.
          </li>
          <li>
            Armbar with one arm fully threaded in and holding the armbar, and
            the other hand on the mat. Competitors must be lined up
            perpendicularly with the competitor on defense flat on his back with
            his feet planted flat on the floor. The defensive competitor can
            only choose a figure four (aka “rear naked choke grip”) defense, or
            a gable grip (aka “palm to palm grip”). No other grips allowed at
            the start of spider web OT.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switching from back control or spider web to any other submission
            (including the truck position, but excluding any other leg lock
            positions) once the time starts is permitted, as long as the
            transition is directly into a fully locked submission. Example:
            switching from armbar to fully locked triangle means the round is
            still going.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If there is a submission in the top of the round, the competitor who
          was submitted needs to secure a submission faster than he or she was
          submitted.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Example: Top of the 1st round, Competitor A submits Competitor B in 30
          seconds. This means that in the Bottom of the 1st round, Competitor B
          needs to submit Competitor A in less than 30 seconds otherwise
          Competitor B loses.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If there is a submission in the bottom of the round, the competitor
          who achieved the submission wins the match (since the other competitor
          was unable to submit their opponent in the top of the round).
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-2 font-karantina text-4xl">
          An escape is when a competitor is fully free from the submission
          position as determined by the referee.
        </h3>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            If you are on defense and your opponent is controlling your arm
            across your body, you must first clear your elbow before it will be
            considered an escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switching from either position to mount means the offensive player
            no longer has a locked in submission, and is thus considered an
            escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submissions from defensive positions count as an escape, not a
            submission.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Always keep escaping, even if you think you’re clear, keep escaping
          until the referee calls time. If competitor on defense thinks he’s out
          and makes gestures to the referee to stop the action, that means the
          escape is NOT complete. Keep escaping keep moving until the referee is
          clear that an escape has been achieved.
